## Project Overview
This project is a clone of the popular word puzzle game **Wordle**.  
Players attempt to guess a hidden 5-letter word within six tries, receiving feedback through colored tiles that indicate correct letters and positions.

The project was designed to practice **React component-based architecture**, **state management**, and **user interaction handling** in a real-world styled game.
